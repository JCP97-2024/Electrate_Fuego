<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. 
I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer 
science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces
 you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this 
 space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy 
to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of 
electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define 
electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix--or you can do a little more work to unconceal,
 opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with
 others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand
 what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer
 literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create!
 I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which
 you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original
 Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Electrate Fuego</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  
  
<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this
 division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic
 function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. 
 We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, 
but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

<div class="hero-image">

      <!--<<<DONE>>>In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. 
	  In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation 
	  or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its 
	  larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes"
	  in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the
 content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="textblock">
  <h1>Software Engineer</h1>
    
  <h2>I strive to learn everything I can regarding computers, both hardware and software, in an effort to further my understanding of Computer Science. It is among the most influential fields of study and deserves profound yet simple rhetoric to accompany the increasingly complex techniques and algorithms used to perpetuate and accomadate societal needs.</h2>    
</div>
    
     
<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path along which you now stand).--> 
    
<div class="textblock">
  <h1>Family and Home</h1>
    </div>
    
<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, 
making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see 
what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing
 local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->
    
<div class="row"> 
  <div class="column">
    <img src="friends1.jpg" alt="friends meeting up">

  </div>
</div>
   
<!--<<<DONE>>> Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."--> 
    
<div class="textblock">
  <h2>Family is whoever you consider close to you. And home is where you feel comfortable. My direct family raised me but my friends made me who I am. I love and adore every one of them.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<div class="textblock">

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life? 

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->  
    
  <h2>I enjoy many different kinds of media. I spend much of my free time playing League of Legends and Factorio. They both have immense depth and yet focus on completely different skillsets. The diversity allows me to escape one by playing the other, creating a nice balance. The video focuses on one of my favorite champions, called Riven. She's very difficult to play but very rewarding when played well.</h2>    
</div>

    <!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) --> 
    
<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)--> 

<div class="textblock">
  <h1>Community</h1>
  
    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
  <h2>I don't consider friends to be part of my "community", because I see community as a larger collective of similar-minded people. And because of that, I often find myself without a "real life" community. I drop anchor at my computer and engage with virtual communities. One of the other games I play is Team Fortress 2, and the people are generally very welcoming, friendly, fun-loving, and good-natured. People like to wear silly hats and mess around rather than play overly competitive. That being said, I also find community in programming groups, chess club, and my local church.</h2>    
  </div>
    
    <div>
 <img src="tf2.jpg" alt="Team Fortress 2_2Fort_Wholesome" class="center-image" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;">
    </div>
    
<!-- In our final discourse section, we will process the role schooling has played in our lives. -->

<div class="textblock"> 
    <h1>School</h1>
</div>
    
<!--To change the image for this wide screen paralax scroll, you will need change the file name in your style.css to match an image in your project folder. Look for ".paralax1" on your style.css sheet-->
  
    <div class="parallax-1"></div>
    
<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->
    
    <div class="textblock">   
  <h2>Pine-Richland High School was simultaneously one of the best and yet most frustrating parts of growing up. I learned so much that I don't think I will ever use in everyday scenarios, yet I learned even more that I've been using all the time during classes. I learned skills like time management, communication, critical thinking, and more. And most importantly I better learned how to interact with people in formal and informal settings. There were a lot of uncertainties going into high school, and even more now that I'm in college, but I feel like I've been prepared well, and I'm grateful for it. I hope I can get a similar experience from Pitt, and I look forward to all the new experiences of college life.</h2>    
  </div>
    
<!--The final step in our process will be to ensure that a smaller version of our "hero image," what Ulmer would refer to as our "wide image," repeats at the bottom of our document to better reinforce this motif.  -->
